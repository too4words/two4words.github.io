## QuantStamp
### What is Quantstamp?
Quantstamp Inc. is developing a protocol that audits smart contracts using formal verification in order to find bugs before contracts are published to the blockchain. Quantstamp developers seek to secure and verify audits using a distributed network of nodes, similar to how an Ethereum node secures and validates a transaction. The Quantstamp protocol aims to be a scalable and cost-effective solution to the smart contract crisis.

###  What problem does Quantstamp solve?
Quantstamp aims to solve the smart contract security crisis. Well over $250 million dollars worth of Ether were either locked or stolen from the Ethereum network due to bugs in smart contracts. Currently, smart contract creators do not have a scalable, cost-effective way to enhance the quality of their code.

Quantstamp aims to create protocol that can automate the auditing process and enhance the quality of smart contracts on the Ethereum network because it’s one major problem present before Ethereum is ready for mainstream adoption.

###  What types of contracts can Quantstamp audit?
Quantstamp aims to develop a protocol that can audit any smart contract from any blockchain. Quantstamp is currently focusing on Ethereum smart contracts but Quantstamp’s long term vision is to be protocol agnostic.
